# Good README Generator


## Description
    I wanted to generate a basic README template that could be applied to any future projects. It was built so that I could both display my node.js abilities, while also saving me time in the future by having a pre-made template available. It eliminates the issue of having to repeatedly design the framework and basic structure of a README file by establishing all this through pre-made files. Node.js is fairly straightfoward, but making the pivot from user-side to command line required how to apply javascript in other scenarios and projects.

## Installation
    The first step is to create a .gitignore file which includes node_modules/ and .DS_Store/. The .gitignore file should be generated before any npm dependencies are installed. The second step is to create a package.json file with the required dependencies. This should also be generated before installation of any dependencies. once you have create a .gitignore and a package.json file, you can initialize this project by going to your terminal line and typing "node index.js".
